                    <li>
                        <strong>Got hands on with computer networking</strong><br>Running a Minecraft server taught me alot about computer networking.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Setup a Virtual Machine on Ubuntu Server</strong><br>
                        Setting up a VM on Ubuntu Server was challenging. I used KVM/QEMU to create a VM running Ubuntu Server to host my Minecraft server, 
                        but I encountered issues accessing the console of the VM within the host OS. To resolve this, I installed XLaunch to use X11 with Windows 10, 
                        which provided access to the GUI environment on the Ubuntu Server guest VM. Since Ubuntu Server is command-line only, this was necessary. I then 
                        used PuTTY to SSH into the VM and access the GUI on my Windows 10 PC.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After all that, I was able to configure the guest OS and install the software needed to host my modded Minecraft server. I used Playit.gg to create a 
                        VPN tunnel, connecting my server to their network, providing a seamless LAN-like experience for users. It‚Äôs a great piece of software that eliminates the 
                        need to open router ports, which could pose security risks, such as the need for an advanced firewall. I trust ISP modem firewalls as much as I 
                        trust a paper canoe.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
                    This was a fantastic project! I learned a lot about networking, especially troubleshooting, which was a significant part of the early setup. Once I got the 
                    hang of it, setting up the Minecraft server went smoothly. I also researched alternatives to avoid opening router ports and found that Playit.gg was the best 
                    solution for my setup.

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Configured</strong> and deployed Pi-hole to filter ads and malicious domains for all devices on the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimized</strong> performance by fine-tuning blocklists and DNS settings for efficient ad-blocking without affecting browsing speed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced network security</strong> by identifying and blocking trackers and unwanted traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrated Pi-hole</strong> with existing home network infrastructure, including dynamic IP configuration and custom DNS settings.</li>

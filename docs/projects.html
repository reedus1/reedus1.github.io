                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Built my own server using computer parts that I had bought. Currenly it is running UbuntuServer with a SambaShare for computer backups and 
                    it is hosting a VM that runs my modded Mineraft Server.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Got hands on with computer networking</strong><br>Running a Minecraft server taught me alot about computer networking.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Setup a Virtual Machine on UbuntuServer</strong> <br> 
                        This was tricky, I used KVM/QEMU to setup a VM running UbuntuServer to host my MineCraft server but I ran into some issues trying to access the console of the VM inside of the host OS "UbuntuServer"
                        So, I had to turn to a GUI environment to get everything up and running correctly. To do this I had to install XLaunch to use X11 with Windows10. X11 gives me a portal to the gui based environment 
                        being ran on my Guest VM UbuntuServer OS. And since Ubuntuserver is a console line interface there is no GUi. Thus I had to use this program. virtual manager on windows.
                        Through Xlaunch hosting the GUI based application on my Windows 10 pc through a Putty SSH Connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After all that I was able to configure the guest OS and install the software I needed to host my modded Minecraft Server.
                        I ended up using playit.gg as the software that would create the VPN tunnel to their servers and out to client pc's "my friends". My server would communicate with their servers 
                        to create a seamingless LAN like experience for the end user's that would be on my Minecraft server.
                        Its a great piece of software and prevents the need of opening ports on my router. As that can create potential security issues I would have to deal with like installing a 
                        more advanced network firewall. Since I trust ISP modem firewalls as much as I trust a paper canoe.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> <br>
                    This was a fantastic project! I learned so much about networking. Mainly troubleshooting as there was alot of that going on in the early process of setting things up.
                    But once I mastered that it was smooth sailing with setting up the Minecraft server. I also did some research into what would be a best alternative for my 
                    setup that would prevent the need of opening ports on the router and sure enough it was playit.gg

                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Implemented a network wide ad-blocking and DNS filtering solution using Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi to my home network.</p>
                <p><strong>Technology used:</strong><br>Raspberry Pi 4b, Linux(Ubuntu Server),Pi-hole,Network Manager</p>
                <p><strong>Key Contributions</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Configured</strong> and deployed Pi-hole to filter ads and malicious domains for all devices on the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimized</strong> performance by fine-tuning blocklists and DNS settings for efficient ad-blocking without affecting browsing speed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced network security</strong> by identifying and blocking trackers and unwanted traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrated Pi-hole</strong> with existing home network infrastructure, including dynamic IP configuration and custom DNS settings.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Reduced data usage, improved network performance and security.</p>

                    Pi-hole, Created by Jacob Salmela in 2014, is a network-wide ad blocker that acts as a DNS-based sinkhole. 
                    It prevents ads, trackers, and malicious domains from loading across all devices connected to a network. Pi-hole does this by comparing DNS queries against a blacklist 
                    of known ad and tracking domains. If a requested domain matches an entry in the blacklist, Pi-hole responds with a null IP address (e.g., 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1), effectively 
                    blocking the domain.

                            During this project, I learned a lot about using Ubuntu Server on my Raspberry Pi (RPI for short). I set up a DNS server on my RPI and then figured out how to communicate with it from my other devices. 
                            The process was straightforward: I configured my router to use the RPI as the primary DNS server instead of the default ISP-provided DNS.

                        <p>
                            To ensure uninterrupted DNS resolution, it‚Äôs important to set a fallback DNS server in case the RPI is unreachable or cannot resolve a query. 
                            Options like Google's DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare's DNS (1.1.1.1) work great as reliable backups.

                        <h3>Why Python?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The main reason for learning Python: Its a very versatile language. 
                            While not the fastest performing language, it can be used in many applications and can go from a concept to a solid project really fast. With the many built in libraries and libraries made from the python community.

                        <p>Pygame is a cross platform python library designed for writing video games and other multimedia applications. 
                            Pygame provides the functionality to create 2D games and graphical applications.</p>
